*Extension Description*
<br>
Have you ever visited a website that seems uninteresting and boring? Have you glazed over the content with nothing occupying your soundscape? Then try out this extension made for those long boring sessions sitting platered in front of a vanilla webpage! In a few clicks you can spice up your experience with funny and memorable sound bytes! Randomized memes is delivered directly to your ear canal, making the sensation that much more memorable.

*Author's note*
<br>
I've thought about how to change web browsing experience for this assignment. I predicted that while most extensions is through visual, I played travelling through another path. By experimenting with how a typical user experience browsing the web, I determine to subvert an expectation (through visual experience) and played with the audio organ. Not only subverting an expectation but also having fun with making an enjoyable experience through popular social memes. I have also played with clicking through links instead and have the user explore the site and every so often hear a random meme. Additionally, making the playability randomized so they experience the memes fresh and not repeated until the queue ran out. However other extenuating factors came in effect and unable to fully add these features.

A new window will then open. Locate "load unpacked" then navigate to the extension folder you downloaded the extension. And Tada!, extension should work.
